    <h1>About the Web</h1>
    <p>The World Wide Web was invented by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989 while working at CERN. He created HTTP and HTML to enable scientists to share documents globally. The first website went live in 1991, revolutionizing information sharing. By the 1990s, the web exploded with Netscape, making the internet accessible to everyone. Search engines like Google transformed how we find information. Today, the web is integral to society.</p>
